# Wynnrunner
## A Fabric-Mod created to make Lootrunning on play.wynncraft.com easier

Features:
* Shows current Beacon-Count and Max Beacon-Count of one Color
* Predicts Challenges of Beacons

## Easy to use

How to Install:
* Download Mod from releases page
* Download https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mysql-jdbc Mod (Not a real Mod, just a library; Not created / maintained by me!)
* Put both Mods in your mod-Folder

How to use:
* just log in to Wynncraft, it will automatically recognice when you start a lootrun and work all by itself
* the beacons will automatically update once you get near to a predicted location OR if you stand still for ~1 second
* They will also automatically update once new beacons appear
* To get more accuracy just let the predictions update by Standing still

* use the /beacons command to show predicted challenge-locations in chat so you can put your Compass

# Currently only works in Lutho as I didn't have the time to register all Challenges in Corkus
## Sorry for this shitty description but it's currently 1:20 a.m. and I got a lot of stuff to do tomorrow
